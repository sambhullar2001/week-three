# what I was trying to do
- continuing recording data of my graves
- annotations of the readings
- trying to make 3D models of the individual graves/tombstones

**Monday:**
- Alrighty! So looking over the work for this week... I'm a super excited! To see these photographs comes to life (in a manner which is oh, so tangible and ***real***) is a prospect which any researcher would love! 
- So, the tasks are ordered in level of difficulty... photogrammetry is "second most difficult" in comparison to recording the grave data, and a bit easier in comparison to the webmap.
- Okay, so I've looked over the software avaible... I've used TinkerCad in the past to make some Marvel props (Matt Murdock's billy clubs if you're interested to know :) )... and so I'll how well that TinkerCad is. **Only reason I'm trying TinkerCad** is because it's all in-browser, and hence, might as well give it a go!**

**Tuesday/Wednesday:**
- Hmm, so TinkerCad was a bust. Apparently the '*Mesh shape is too complex. Tinkercad meshes are limited to 300,000 triangles". 
- Not a fun error message to recieve, but one I suppose I'll have to work around. I have the feeling, however, that it might be something on my end - considering the elborate shapes one can make in the program... a simple cross grave should be enough for it to handle, no?
- However, I AM now thinking of other softwares. Specifically the ones on Digiarch... I'll probably download Regard3d and spend the rest of the day watching tutorial videos, and converting my .heic photos to jpgs... because Google Drive LOVES adding to my massive workload :) 

**Rest of the week**:
- okay, so clearly I must've used up all my luck somewhere else... because NOTHING is seemingly working!
- I have tried creating 3D meshes for ALL of the graves that I had documented, and they end up similar to the following mesh:

When clicking that Link you'll be re-directed to a Sketchfab mesh, which is a 3d "model" of the grave of a certain, Sir Arthur Percy Sherwood - a decorated Canadian police comissioner and integral figure in early Canadian counter-intelliegence. However, it is clear that the program DID NOT mesh his grave correctly; either that, or I, MYSELF, did not input the pictures clearly. 
- when moving the cursor over the mesh, and moving the model around, it becomes clear that the model itself is just a 3-d representation of a 2-d picture. Which leads me to believe that the program isn't "meshing" the pictures together to create a model... rather just utilising one. 
- As of writing this log (Saturday, Oct 2), I haven't come up with a solution... but I'm looking.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
- not ***much*** researching this time around; very tech-oriented week for me. That bein said, however, it was interesting seeing the parallels within the annotations/readings of the different grave styles (more to be discussed in journal!)

## challenges 
- creating a proper 3d model
- working through the software

## thoughts on where to go next
- This week was mainly trial and error and trial and error... and error once again. By far the most frustationg week as it seems as if NOTHING would go right.... but I suppose that is just how research goes, huh?
- Looking over next week... seems to be a catch up week. As a result, I'll be spending it working on the 3-D models (perhaps going back to Beechwood to collect a plethora of more photographs and images to aide the modelling efforts) and working towards the Consilidation week!
