# Introduction 
This week was definitely the most frustrating one yet. Seemingly none of my proposed plans had worked, and the huge, optimistic smile I had etched onto my face Monday, had all but disappeared by Saturday.

Alas... that is a researchers woe - too dramatic?

## Interesting Quotes from the Readings

**Alright, so most of the quotes that I found interesting were not necessarily ones in a much deeper context... rather, ones which paralleled the graves and sites I encountered at Beechwood!**

"*Rural garden cemeteries were a part of a larger movement designed to beautify and  
celebrate death in nineteenth-century America. Death was embraced as a part of living  
culture, and elaborate spaces, rituals, and language speci!cally to express emotions of  
loss and suffering when a loved one died were considered essential elements of  
mourning and commemoration.*" (2020. Emotional Practice and Emotional Archaeology- A Perspective from the Archaeology of Childhood in Kisha Supernant, Jane Eva Baxter, Natasha Lyons, Sonya Atalay (eds). Archaeologies of the Heart, Springer, Cham)

- this was a cool quote to encounter, just because I could see the parallels to Beechwood Cemetry within them. The area is organized in a very decorative manner, and often times - when walking the trails of the cemetery, one can almost forget that they're walking alongside the final resting place of thousands of people... rather it feels almost as if you're walking down a serene pathway.

"*Children became particularly potent symbols of home and family life during this  
time of upheaval and social change, and their grave markers reflect this through designs conveying innocence, purity, and home. Messages expressed through headstone design were reinforced by childrenâ€™s epitaphs and consolation literature, which was a popular genre for parents at a time of high infant and child mortality.*" (2020. Emotional Practice and Emotional Archaeology- A Perspective from the Archaeology of Childhood in Kisha Supernant, Jane Eva Baxter, Natasha Lyons, Sonya Atalay (eds). Archaeologies of the Heart, Springer, Cham)

- Once again, I found this quote really interesting considering the fact that there were, unfortunately, graves of children.
- Most notably during my research I had found 2 children's graves. One from the Whitehead familial headstone, of Mary Jane Whitehead (Nov 13 (18?) 1856 - Nov 10 1860) and the other from the Booth familial headstone, simply titled 'Baby Booth' (May 3rd 1873-April 1st 1874). Interestingly, enough both did not possess epitaphs or consolations literature, as described in the reading, of any kind. Perhaps because of the familial nature of the headstone - which encompassed and served generations of family members - that it was not felt appropriate. However, it was a huge shock to discover when initially researching the grave.

***In terms of  broader analysis of Beechwood Cemetery...

There are certainly some interesting patterns to dissect. To begin, there is a clear indication of commemorative design in the graves/headstones of much more "renowned" Canadians. For instance, Lot 48 was the primary area of my study - as it possessed much more older headstones (according to the Beechwood keepers), and I had interest in the older headstones. When entering the stone-fenced area, I immediately noticed that one grave-head stood a part from the rest - that being the head stone of **James Dyson Slater**. Name sound familiar? If so, I'm not surprised... *there is a* street named after him in Ottawa! Now, the Beechwood Staff was kind enough to give me a book of historical portraits. According to the manuscript, Slater was a renowned Canadian engineer who worked extensively on the Canal system of Ottawa. Furthermore, he featured as a "Great Canadian Profile" in numerous Beechwood tours, which take those interested, around the area and explain the graves of *famous* Canadians. Back to the headstone, Slater's was large and overbearing - approximately 2 metres in height. His headstone was similar to that of a cuboid pedestal (code 9440 on the Graveyard Recording sheet for easier access), a stark contrast to the small and (nearly) decaying headstones of the deceased which surrounded him. I did not manage to collect photographic data of Slater's headstone, as a result, I cannot remember surely what was written on the headstone. However, ***I did*** collect data on another commemorative headstone - that of Colonel Sir Arthur Percy Sherwood (18 Mar 1854 - 15 Oct 1940). As with Slater, Sherwood is also mentioned in Beechwood's historical portaits memoir. The memoir describes Sherwood as a successful man in law enforcement, who would oversee Canada's "secret" division during WW1. Similarly to Slater, Sherwood's grave is ALSO out of place in comparison to the ones which surround it. His is nicely decorated, with engraved flowers - while the inscriptions stay crisp and clear, for all to read.

- now it is unknown if such disparity in conservation of headstones is something to argue against the cemetry grounds themselves. From an economic viewpoint, it would make sense to only (regularly) clean and maintain the graves which the genera public would find interest in (e.g, ex-prime ministers, scientists, actors, famous soliders etc.), as it would bring revenue in the form of tourism for the cemetery. However, also conversely, one could argue that perhaps a duty of care is thrust upon the cemetery upon housing the deceased's body.

***In terms of emotions***:

It certainly brings a twinge of sadness to know that certain deceased are "perferred" or "matter" over the other. I understand that this is an archaeology class, and not one on philosphy, however it forces you to wonder that perhaps we, as humans, ***are not*** our best intentions... we ***are*** what we ***do***. 

And yet... we still have the capacity to feel for those who were just ***regular*** people. There was a terrible, terrible feeling of dread I had when I looked at the grave of Baby Booth or Mary Jane Whitehead, because though I had never lost a child before, I could ***empathise*** with the feeling. I felt strange guilt when walking the premises with my camera, because I felt as if I was treading on sacred land - as if I was ***intruding*** on something I had no right to. This is a feeling of compassion which transcends the modern era. Humans thousands of years ago, felt the need to appropriately fill the graves/tombs of their loved ones in a compassionate manner - be it with graved goods, or personal belongings. Death was seen was a sacred, unknown journey then... just as it is ***now***. 
 
 
 
 **To Conclude**
All in all, it was a bit of a frustrating week - given most of the modelling was a bit of a mess. However, it was nice to sort of debrief and ponder over the values and contents I had just collected. Mortuary archaeology is certainly interesting... however it is also a bit... sad. Death is a very complicated manner in and of itself... it is tough trying to reduce it into something that can be logically manouvered around. 



***As for feedback***, Is there anything else I'm missing? What else would you like to see from my writing? I know Consolidation week is coming up, So I'd like to put my best work forward for that!
